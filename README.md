# Radiance

Radiance is a renderer and asset system.

Requires hardware raytracing, mesh shaders, and ReBAR to work at all.

# Testing

Build and run with `cargo run --release`, and open the folder `test-project`.

Double click folders/assets to navigate around, and drop a GLTF file into the window to import.
